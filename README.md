# Conjectures!

Hello fellow math nerd (well I kinda suck at math, oh well)! I wrote some code to test 2 famous conjectures, the Collatz Conjecture and the Goldbach's Conjecture! So far I haven't broken the math universe yet, but maybe you will! Enjoy!

## How to use:
Clone this repo in any IDE and run a file of your choosing! Or click on the replit URL on the side bar (over there >>) to run it easily!

## Proven a conjecture false?
Huh, are you sure? If so tell your teacher ig and become famous! Pls credit me in like the very corner of the credits end roll that no one reads at the end of the movie you get to feature in for being famous!*

*jk, but if you **somehow** do prove it false, noice!
